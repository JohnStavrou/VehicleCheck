VehicleCheck is a Windows Application developed to make your life easier since you no longer have to keep track of
the validity of your vehicle's important papers. All you have to do is enter the expiration date of the paper and the
app will let you know if it needs renewing. For now, the app informs you just by changing the colors of the UI, but later
an email service will be added sending you a warning mail in advance!
